		<desc>Bokoblins are often encountered in primitive encampments. They can be found resting inside their camps at night and hunting Boars, if they are present, during the day. 
		Bokoblin encampments are usually guarded by a Bokoblin on a small watchtower. If this Bokoblin spots Link, it will sound its horn, alerting the other Bokoblins of Link's presence.
		There are four known colors of Bokoblins: the standard red variety, the significantly stronger blue variety, the elite black variety, and the incredibly rare silver variety.</desc>
